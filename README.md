### Website
https://repl.it/languages
</br>
I find this website interesting because it allows quick and easy setup of most languages. This is really useful when you want to test some code really quickly. This allows you to test really quickly all within your browser. There is no need to open a text file and compile code on a terminal or wait for an IDE to open. You don't have to deal with file systems or accidnetally naming something wrong that crashes your code. This website takes care of the setup and lets you code immediately so your work flow isn't interrupted.
